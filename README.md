This project focuses on analyzing HR data using Power BI to track workforce trends, attendance, and work from home patterns. The data was gathered and cleaned using Power Query to ensure accuracy for meaningful analysis. Using Power BI data models, trends in attendance and remote work were analyzed, providing valuable insights into workforce distribution. Interactive dashboards were developed to visualize key metrics such as attendance percentages, work from home trends, and employee distribution across teams. These insights helped identify increasing remote work patterns, enabling better workforce planning, team engagement strategies, and release scheduling. By leveraging data driven decision making, this project supports efficient workforce management and future client project planning.
